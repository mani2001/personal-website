                       <p> The rise of exponential technologies in recent times has been a blessing to human society. Innovation is at its peak, and I am positive the trend will continue further on. I am immensely passionate and eager to contribute to these various technologies, the main one being Intelligent systems that work on the principles of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Personally, I adore the crossover of deep learning tech with the medical field to solve both diagnosis and medication level problems using neural networks. I have a desire of working in Med-Tech startups that extensively use machine learning as it is a field close to my heart. Parallelly, I am also fascinated by the combination of AI and NLP in the art domain. I extensively enjoy using tools like OpenAI DALL-E and Midjourney, both of which use natural language to synthesize images. It would be an understatement to say that I would be excited to work in such domains. I feel pursuing a master's in the field of Machine learning, NLP, and AI, in general, will give a massive boost to my existing skillset and enlighten me in areas that I am not very familiar with. It will also help me attain the necessary contacts to execute ideas in my mind and bring them to reality. A master’s degree will be fruitful for me even in finding a suitable job opportunity where I would be able to work on the newer technologies and research ideas both on a theoretical and implementation level.</p> <p>

My fascination with Artificial Intelligence started in my early teen when I was introduced to the concept of the famous Turing test. To be able to make a machine imitate human levels of cognition has always bewildered me. This led me to opt for a bachelor’s course in the field of computer science with a specialization in Machine learning. During the duration of my undergraduate degree, I’ve worked on diverse projects and internships that revolved completely or partially around Intelligent systems.</p>

<p>My experience in coding (both in C++ and python) and my knowledge of data structures helped me extensively. In one of my internships, I worked on the design and implementation of knowledge graphs using NoSQL and gRPC API framework. This helped me learn the importance of data storage and serialization of data and their immense role in the construction of scalable ML models.  I have also done a project on Agent navigation, where I implemented Reinforcement learning models like Q-Learning and Deep Q networks on custom-generated 2-D obstacle maps. During my coursework, I have also intensively studied concepts on data analysis, preprocessing, model creation and the various techniques of machine learning and deep learning. These courses have given me an in-depth understanding of several concepts both on theoretical and implementational levels. I carry a decent experience in fields like computer vision, where I have performed edge case testing on a few OpenCV-based APIs and built conclusions around it. This was a government-level project. Other than core machine learning, I possess web development skills, especially in the design of robust backend systems.</p>

I bring with me, strong communication and team skills, other than my technical aptitude. My internship experiences and project presentation have helped me gain a lot of people-oriented skills which I am forever grateful for. I believe I could leverage these skills in my graduate studies at your prestigious institution to collaborate with professors and fellow students to work on beneficial and futuristic projects. The research groups at your institution have further increased my excitement, to work with great minds and collaborate on state-of-art projects.

With my master’s degree and work experience that I will attain, later, I plan to start my own venture that would use exponential technologies to make people’s lives easier and better. I also have a desire to teach curious students about different subject matters to impart the knowledge I’ve gained to others.
